        <img src="me.JPG" alt="What Cristan Garza looks like">
        <p>I'm from Allen, Texas and currently play on StepUp 18 Elite</p>
        <p>Outside hitter is my position</p>
        <p>I love serve-receive</p>
        <p>I am not a flashy player whatsoever, which is fabulous</p>
        <p>My standing reach is 8'1</p>
        <p>The highest I've ever approach-touched is 11'1, but I'm only getting to about 10'10 right now (for the past few months I've been running instead of lifting)</p>
        <p>My SAT score was a 1490 (EBRW: 740, Math: 750) but I'm willing to retake</p>
        <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10FPzz2QXqFVFFAZI2Giuqlh4E9Cftt-q/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here is a link to my high school transcript</a></p>
        <p>I have Asperger's; volleyball is actually one of the few activities that, while partaking, the overhwhelming-ness of social occurences/outside seem to fade away for me</p>
        <p>Having autism does not affect my ability to be a great leader/teammate (my coach's name is Andrii Diachkov if you need to verify that truth)</p>
        <p>I intend to dual major in computer science and public policy, though my passion is slowly drifting away from technical subjects</p>
        <p>The passions I have for academia and creative expression derive from an obsession with non-exploitive production, along with an intense craving for the surreal and fulfilling moments that give people goosebumps</p>
        <p>My favorite album of all time is Negro Swan by Blood Orange</p>
